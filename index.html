                A library is a very useful platform that brings together people willing to learn. It helps us in
                learning and expanding our knowledge. We develop our reading habits from a library and satisfy our
                thirst and curiosity for knowledge. This helps in the personal growth of a person and development.
                Similarly, libraries provide authentic and reliable sources of information for researchers. They are
                able to complete their papers and carry out their studies using the material present in a library.
                Furthermore, libraries are a great place for studying alone or even in groups, without any disturbance.
                Moreover, libraries also help in increasing our concentration levels. As it is a place that requires pin
                drop silence, a person can study or read in silence. It makes us focus on our studies more efficiently.
                Libraries also broaden our thinking and make us more open to modern thinking.
                Most importantly, libraries are very economical. The people who cannot afford to buy new books and can
                simply borrow books from a library. This helps them in saving a lot of money and getting information for
                free.

                Library buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and
                collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance:
                computers and access to the Internet. The library's clientele and services offered vary depending on its
                type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library or academic
                library, for example. Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people
                engage in lifelong learning. Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a
                building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet.

                The services the library offers are variously described as library services, information services, or
                the combination "library and information services", although different institutions and sources define
                such terminology differently.

                Libraries may provide physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical location or a
                virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts,
                films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books,
                audiobooks, databases, table games, video games and other formats. Libraries range widely in size, up to
                millions of items.

                Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to facilitate
                group study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their electronic
                resources and the Internet. Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by
                people who choose not to—or cannot afford to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need
                material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with
                their research.

                Services offered by a library are variously described as library services, information services, or the
                combination "library and information services", although different institutions and sources define such
                terminology differently.
